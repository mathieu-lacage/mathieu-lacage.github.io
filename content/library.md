Over the past 20+ years, I have been avidly collecting
technical books on writing code, management, etc. One of my
pet projects is to get people around me to read some of these
when I see an opportunity to share what I learned. Here they are !

## Project Management

on what makes software projects late.

### The Art Of Project Management

[Scott Berkun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180217)

A look at every facet of managing software projects and the people
who build them. This book contains a very good bibliography that inspired
a lot of the references here.

and quality in the face of changing business parameters, and humans.

### Software Engineering Economics

[Barry W. Boehm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1011250)

Super dry, dated, but still interesting to understand how things worked
back in the days of the waterfall model

## Business

### The ten-day MBA

[Steven Silbiger](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141850)

If you do you have any financial background, this is a great introduction

why business people seem to always pick the wrong side of an argument.

This book won a Pulitzer prize in 1982: it tells the story of how a 32-bit minicomputer
was built by a small team of engineers led by [Tom West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_West).
He became a model for what I thought a great manager should be.

### Back into the Storm

[Bil Herd](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58673360)

Maybe the reason I feel so ambivalent about this book is because I am probably
more similar to Bil Herd than I'd like to admit. It's still a fascinating
look into how seemingly impossible projects still hapen to be delivered
on time.

## People

### Sources of power

[Gary Klein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65229)

The cheesiest title of all that does not give justice to its content.

it is a terrific reference on algorithms for computer graphics

A super dry reference on lots of types of algorithms useful for searching
in text or other types of content.

[Erich Gamma, Richard Heml, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85009)

it over and over until you can master what it describes.

### Design Patterns Explained

[Alan Shalloway, James R. Trott](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85021)

This is the book that I have always wanted to write about design

system software works and how you would go about implementing one.

### C++ Templates

[Vandevoorde, Josuttis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/806932)
