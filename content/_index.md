# Hi there

I am Mathieu: these pages are here to share content I have produced over the years. 
Most of this content is ancient and will be of little use to most readers. If,
however, you have found some of it useful or interesting, please, let me know:
<mathieu.lacage@cutebugs.net> works usually pretty well.

If you're looking for my professional profile, [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieulacage/) 
has you covered. Maybe a [pdf resume](/pdf/resume-software.pdf) ?
